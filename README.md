# Down to Earth: Are earthquakes local events, or influenced by the local (solar) environment?

This project's goal will be to collect information on the timing, location and severity of earthquakes; 
using the [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/); 
and passing this on to [Astronomy API](https://docs.astronomyapi.com/v/v2/) to collect information
on the position of solar system objects as observed from the given time and location.    
I propose then to perform an analysis on this data to look for correlations of earthquake timing 
and serverity to relative positions of astronomical bodies.    
Working from the null hypothesis (random timing and location of earthquakes), it will
then be necessary to perform an additional analysis to determine statistical signifigance of
any findings.

Conceived and conducted as a final project for the WBS Coding School Data Science Bootcamp, 
the code and analysis were developed over slightly more than two weeks in 2023.    
Orginally developed using Python v3.9.13 and JupyterLab v3.4.4
